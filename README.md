# Python-User-Input
# User Input
Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

The method is a bit difference in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.

Python 3.6 uses the input() method.

Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

# Python 3.6
    username = input("Enter username:")
    print("Username is: " + username)


# Python 2.7
    username = raw_input("Enter username:")    
    print("Username is: " + username)
    #This is just for python 2.7 usual support
